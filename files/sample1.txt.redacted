	Stan, the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to ████████ in accepting OneOk's suggestion that we rewrite the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-██████ ██████ █████ ████ measurement agreement.  
  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Measurement Agreement.  
  The following are talking points that ████ ████████ will use today in a conversation with █████ ███████, who is █████ ███████'s boss.  
  Since ███████'s proposal (which I sent to you by email last week) was a draft and has never been formally sent to us, we decided that having ████ deliver our message to █████ made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and █ohn ██████'s level.  
  However, if ██████ calls you and raises the issue of their proposal, the following points contain our message.  
  ███████ may agree in the call with ████ to reconcile the April and May imbalance based on our metered numbers.  
  If not, █████ has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling.  
  I believe that ██████ indicated that he'd be calling you back this week to talk about this matter, so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter.  
  I'll forward the demand letter for your review separately.  
  ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████  
  We expect to get that deal in place with them soon.  
  This is a good development for them, and with little or no risk to us, and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their measurment proposal.  
  Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.  
  Thanks.  
  DF



 

1.  
  █████ ███████'s suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's █████ ████ measurement agreement with ██████ ██████.  
  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  
  That structure is very different from the ████████-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from ████████'s ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a "BTU measurement error" (i.e., when the chromatograph malfunctions).  
  2.  
  ████████ is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the █████ meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  
  ONEOK's independent outside experts, ██████ and █████, confirmed this fact during the arbitration.  
  3.  
  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a "special test" of the accuracy of ████████'s ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  
  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  
  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.  
  4.  
  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the █████ ████ procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.  
  5.  
  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on ████████'s meters.  
  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  
  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of ████████'s meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  
  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, ████████ will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.
